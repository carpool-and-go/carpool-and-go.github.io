## Group Member Agreement
This web application is made in cooperation with Kenji Sanehira, Cory Parker, Robin Dumlao, Michael Ito, Johanan Leoncio, and Kai Sequeira.

## Overview
Carpool and Go! is a web application project mockup that aims to provide a communal network for University of Hawaii at Manoa, allowing for drivers to offer rides and for riders to be able to search for rides in their area. This application is created by ICS software engineering students through the means of:

## Project Goals
Our goal with this project is to take in what we have learned over the course of the semester to create a functioning meteor application that reflects the teachings as well as the creative freedoms we get to choose while creating this project. By working together in a team environment, we aim to gain experience as well as further our practice in web design. Also, by creating a mockup for a service in an attempt to combat a real world problem, we hope to be able to translate this problem solving into other scenarios in real world applications.

## Touring the Interface
As we progress and further develop the website application, we will be showing the different aspects of our website and pages here. This is where the final product and how to navigate through the website will go. Currently there is nothing yet, but stay tuned!

    Pages (WIP) //this will be describing what users see when they first enter the
    website, how to create an account, what can they do after, etc.

## What the System Should Eventually Provide
What this system should eventually provide is a website service that allows University of Hawaii at Manoa students and staff the ability to have access to get to school with having less cars needed to traverse the roads. Users who log in can either look to offer rides, or search for possible drivers that they can catch a ride with to campus. By offering this service, we hope to do our part to help against the rising gas prices and heavy traffic near the University.

## Development Mockup Pages
This section will show how the website looks like during each stage of the development. Since it is very early in the stages, there is nothing yet, but stay tuned! Different from [touring the interface,](#touring-the-interface) this section will show the changes of these website pages over time, rather than the end result.

## Development History
Milestones are important! This project undergoes the developmental process practices in order to create a fully functioning meteor proof-of-concept prototype. This section is dedicated to keeping track of milestone goals and how we managed to achieve them.
